    <!--MAGAZINE DESCRIPTION-->
    <div class="mag_info_wrap">
        <p class="magazine_info_col1">The Crisis is the official magazine of the National Association for the
            Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). It was founded in 1910 by W. E. B. Du Bois (editor), Oswald Garrison
            Villard, J. Max Barber, Charles Edward Russell, Kelly Miller, William Stanley Braithwaite, and Mary Dunlop
            Maclean. The Crisis has been in continuous print since 1910, and it is the oldest black oriented magazine in
            the world.[1] Today, The Crisis is "a quarterly journal of civil rights, history, politics and culture and
            seeks to educate and challenge its readers about issues that continue to plague African Americans and other
            communities of color.</p>

        <p class="magazine_info_col1">The original title of the magazine was The CRISIS: A Record of The Darker Races.
            The magazine's name was inspired by James Russell Lowell's 1844 poem, The Present Crisis. The suggestion to
            name the magazine after the poem came from one of the NAACP co-founders and noted white abolitionist Mary
            White Ovington. The first issue was typed and arranged by NAACP secretary Richetta Randolph Wallace.</p>

        <p class="magazine_info_col1">The Chicago Tribune named The Crisis one of its "50 Favorite Magazines" in 2008,
            stating: "This venerable publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has
            continued to evolve and illuminate since its premiere issue in November 1910 (one year after the creation of
            the NAACP)</p>
